Hi, Iâ€™m @3LittleGoats!
The main reason behind this repository is to store programming projects that I think are interesting and may be useful for others.
Currently, I am interested in Python 3 and Arduino C/C++.
I probably won't be a very interactive user here on GitHub. Any code you see from me will probably not receive updates.
